Unfortunately, this is version 1.8.8

online version is https://svaaps.github.io/eaglercrafthtml/
(online version also saves individual worlds too and works just as normal as the local version but you don't have to download anything)
if you wanna play eaglercraft locally, its in releases

you can also clone this to make your own copy of the web version of eaglercraft!
